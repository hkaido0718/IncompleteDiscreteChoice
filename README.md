# Python Libraries for Incomplete Discrete Choice Models

This repository collects python libraries for estimating discrete choice models. Currently, it contains the following files.

- `idclib.py`: The main library
- `examples.py`: Additional files for the examples used in the colab notebooks.

# Tutorials

The following Jupyter Notebooks (developed using Google Colab) review the basics of discrete choice models and illustrate how to use the library.
- `CompleteModel.ipynb`: A review of a binary choice model
- `IncompleteModel.ipynb`: A reviwe of a two-player discrete game
